Known Bugs
. In credits, when 'Double Creations' shows, the last rows of z-values is 
messed up/missing
. The permanent white bug in top-left corner has returned! I fixed it for the 
90x70 3D image, but it has returned to widescreen somehow.
. Not so much a bug as an annoying part of the design, but the initialization 
of the light tables when the screensaver starts isn't very visually appealing. 
Perhaps there is someway to circumvent it?

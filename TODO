. Use a config file for windows and have key to save settings
   . Make the settings button open the config file in notepad
      or $EDITOR if it exists on windows
. Need to add entry to ~/.xscreensaver, some distros don't do this
. Add additional 3D images, with more variety/characters
. Perhaps start using autotools, for better portability.

TODO
. Have a --without-xscreensaver option for configure, so that
the build won't fail if someone wants to use matrixgl with a 
different screensaver manager (or just to run from a shell..)
. Use a config file for windows and have key to save settings
   . Make the settings button open the config file in notepad
      or $EDITOR if it exists on windows
   . Perhaps have the same functionality in *NIX, if 
   --without-xscreensaver  is passed to the configure script. 
   A bash alias would surfice, so I don't know how useful it 
   would be.
. Need to add entry to ~/.xscreensaver, some distros don't do this
. Limit framerate to ~45fps, in a portable way.
   . Can't use usleep or equivilent, as a system with a poor
   timer granularity will make it too slow. 
   . Using gettimeofday may work, just checking if enough 
   time has passed each loop around. It uses most of the CPU
   anyways..
. Add additional 3D images, with more variety/characters
. Add ability to pass a directory of jpeg images, which we'll
parse and display instead of the defaults.
. Test on opensolaris

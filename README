2. DEPENDENCIES
===============
The Mac OSX and Windows installers handle dependencies automatically. For
Unix-like platforms (e.g Linux, BSD, Solaris) the following dependencies are
required to build from source:

i) XLib + development files
      You need to have the X11 libraries and header files (which are sometimes
      split into two different packages.) Look through your package manager for
      names including 'xlib', 'libx11' and 'xorg', and read the descriptions.

         - Ubuntu packages: libx11-dev
         - Gentoo packages: x11-libs/libX11
         - FreeBSD ports:   /usr/ports/x11/libX11/

ii) OpenGL + development files
      You need to have the OpenGL library and header files (which are sometimes
      split into two different packages.) Look through your package manager for
      names including 'libgl', 'mesa', and 'opengl', and read the descriptions.

         - Ubuntu packages: mesa-common-dev, libgl1-mesa-dev
         - Gentoo packages: media-libs/mesa
         - FreeBSD ports:   /usr/ports/graphics/libGL/

iii) OpenGL Utility Library (GLU) + development files
      You need to have the GLU library and header files (which are sometimes
      split into two different packages.) Look through your package manager for
      names including 'glu', 'mesa' and 'libglu', and read the descriptions.

         - Ubuntu packages: libglu1-mesa-dev
         - Gentoo packages: media-libs/glu
         - FreeBSD ports:   /usr/ports/graphics/libGLU/

iv) XScreenSaver (OPTIONAL)
      XScreenSaver is an optional dependency that is enabled by default. Pass
      --without-xscreensaver to the configure script to compile without it.
      XScreenSaver is a decent screensaver manager/daemon, and it is
      recommended that you use it.

         - Ubuntu packages:  xscreensaver
         - Gentoo packages:  x11-misc/xscreensaver
         - FreeBSD ports:   /usr/ports/x11/xscreensaver/
   

3. COMPILING AND INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
=======================================
To compile and install from source on a Unix-like system, open a terminal and
cd(1) to your download directory. To extract the source code, run the following
commands:

   $ tar xzf matrixgl-2.3.2.tar.gz
   $ cd matrixgl-2.3.2

To compile and build, run the following commands:

   $ ./configure
   $ make

To install, run:

   $ sudo make install

   --OR--

   $ su
   # make install

If you have not disabled XScreenSaver support, there is one more step to get it
working. xscreensaver-demo(1) doesn't automatically detect new screensavers, so
you have to add an entry to your ~/.xscreensaver config. Our script can do this
for you:

   $ ./add-user-entry.sh

Note that every user has their own ~/.xscreensaver file, so this step must be
completed by anyone who wishes to add matrixgl to their xscreensaver-demo(1)
list. To run matrixgl as a screensaver, run 'xscreensaver-demo' and select
'matrixgl' from the list.

See the INSTALL file for more advanced instructions. If for any reason the
build process fails, please send a bug report (as described below), and we will
help you out.


4. INSTALLING ON MAC OSX
========================
Stephane Sudre ported matrixgl to Mac OSX, and it works with OSX 10.4 or later.
You can download the installer and source code from:
   http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/matrixgl.html


5. INSTALLING ON WINDOWS
========================
To install on Windows, download and run the Windows installer from the project
homepage. Matrixgl can then be run and configured via the standard Windows
"Screen Saver" dialog.


6. REPORTING BUGS
==================
If you've found a bug, or are having any troubles compiling, installing or
running matrixgl, we have a script that will generate a bug report for you.
Open up a terminal in your download directory and run the following commands:

   $ cd matrixgl-2.3.2
   $ ./gen-bug-report.sh

This will generate a file named 'bug_report'. Please attach the file to an
email to vincent@doublecreations.com, along with a brief description of your
problem.
